/*
We have a car dealership that sells and leases many models all off one make - Chevrolet.
We specify each car by its model, year, and color and we keep a record of when each car was purchased and for how much.
We record whether it was sold or leased and for how much.
The price of a lease is the total of the payments received for the lease period.
Once purchased, we want to enter the customer's information - first name, last name, and phone number -into the system.
We only deal with new vehicles at this site and when the leases are returned they are resold at another site.

Questions:
Q: Would the dealership ever purchase a car from the previous year to sell?
A: No, if we have it left in our inventory, we would sell it, but initially we would only purchase this year's or next year's model.
In any case, we wouldn't sell a car more than five years old.

Q: Is it possible to purchase a future year's model?
A; Yes, next year's model usually is available towards the end of the current year,
but obviously not the model for two or more years in advance.

Q:What is the highest and lowest price you would sell a car?
A:We haven't sold a car for less than $20,000 or leased for less than $10000 in a long time and prices are only going up.
As far as the maximum, we plan to be in business for years to come and it's hard to know what prices will be like.

Q:Do you need to keep on record the customer's address as well?
A: No.
